Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classFSIRingProblem}{FSIRing\+Problem}} \\*FSI Ring problem\+: a fluid-\/structure interaction problem in which a viscous fluid bounded by an initially circular beam is set into motion by a small sinusoidal perturbation of the beam (the domain boundary) }{\pageref{classFSIRingProblem}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classOscRingNStProblem}{Osc\+Ring\+NSt\+Problem$<$ ELEMENT $>$}} \\*Driver for oscillating ring problem\+: Wall performs oscillations that resemble eigenmodes of freely oscillating ring and drives viscous fluid flow. Mean radius of wall is adjustable and responds to a pressure value in the fluid to allow for mass conservation }{\pageref{classOscRingNStProblem}}{}
